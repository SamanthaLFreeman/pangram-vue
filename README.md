# Pangram Vue

For this take home challenge, I was expected to fork an existing repo from Stackblitz and create a form which checks if the user has written a Pangram or not. Pangrams are sentences that use every letter of the alphabet (.i.e. “A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”). If correct, it was to return "Pangram!" and if incorrect the message would include all of the missing letters. The sentence may include lowercase, uppercase or special characters. A user is unable to submit the form until they have entered a value into the input.

### Setup

1. Clone down repo `git clone <url>`
2. cd into directory
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run serve` to view on localhost:8080
